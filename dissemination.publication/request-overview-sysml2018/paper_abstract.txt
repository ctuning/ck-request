Co-designing efficient machine learning based systems across
the whole hardware/software stack to trade off speed, accuracy, energy
and costs is becoming extremely complex and time consuming.
Researchers often struggle to evaluate and compare different
published works across rapidly evolving software
frameworks, heterogeneous hardware platforms, compilers,
libraries, algorithms, data sets, models, and environments.

We present our community effort to develop an open co-design tournament 
platform with an online public scoreboard.
It will gradually incorporate best research practices 
while providing a common way for multidisciplinary researchers
to optimize and compare the quality vs. efficiency Pareto
optimality of various workloads on diverse and complete
hardware/software systems.
As a long-term goal, we want to build a public repository 
of the most efficient algorithms and systems
which can be easily reused and built upon.
