\section{Extended Abstract}

\subsection{Technical Description}
{\em Obligatory. Provide a technical desciption of your novel work, or references to
your already published work which you are providing an artifact for.}

\subsection{Empirical Evaluation}
{\em Obligatory. Provide empirical evaluation results of the technique together with improved metrics, 
optimization, or exploration which you are providing an artifact for, and discuss the insights 
that the evaluation provides. The methodology can be discussed in more details in the artifact appendix.}
