\section{Extended Abstract}

\subsection{Technical Description}
{\em Obligatory. Provide a technical description of your new work, 
or references to your already published work which you are providing an artifact for.}

\subsection{Empirical Evaluation}
{\em Obligatory. Provide empirical evaluation results of the technique together with improved metrics, 
optimization, or exploration which you are providing an artifact for, and discuss the insights 
that the evaluation provides. The methodology can be discussed in more details in the artifact appendix.}

\subsection{Artifact check-list (meta-information)}

{\em Obligatory. Use a few informal keywords in all the fields applicable to your artifacts
and remove the rest. This information is needed to find appropriate reviewers and gradually 
unify artifact meta information in Digital Libraries.}
