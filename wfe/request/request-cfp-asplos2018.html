<a id="call"><h3>Call for submissions</h3>

<p>
The 1st ReQuEST tournament is co-located with <a href="https://www.asplos2018.org">ACM ASPLOS'18</a>
and will focus solely on optimizing the whole software/hardware stack for image classification
based on <a href="http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC"><b>ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)</b></a>.

However, unlike the classical ILSVRC where submissions are ranked based
on accuracy, ReQuEST submissions will be evaluated 
on complete platforms across multiple metrics and trade-offs selected by authors 
(speed, accuracy, energy,  throughput, device price, usage cost, etc.)
in a unified, reproducible and comparable fashion
using <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck">Collective Knowledge framework (CK)</a>.

Restricting the competition to a single application domain will allow us 
to test our open-source ReQuEST tournament infrastructure, 
validate it across multiple platforms and environments, 
and prepare a dedicated live scoreboard with results
similar to this <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/repo">public CK dashaboard</a>.

<p>
We encourage participants to target accessible, off-the-shelf hardware to allow
our evaluation committee to conveniently reproduce their results. Example systems include:
<ul>
 <li> 
  Server-class: AWS/Azure cloud instance, any x86-based desktop system.
 </li>
 <li>
  Mobile-class: Any ARM-based (e.g. NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Raspberry Pi 3, Xilinx PYNQ board), or Intel-Atom-based SoC development board, Android-based smartphone or tablets.
 </li>
 <li>
  IoT-class: Low-power ARM micro-controllers (e.g. Freescale FRDM KL03 Development Board).
 </li>
</ul>

If a submission relies on an exotic hardware platform, the participants can
either provide restricted access to their evaluation platform
to the artifact evaluation committee, or at least notify 
us in advance (at least 3 weeks notice) about their choice 
so that a similar platform can be acquired in time 
(assuming costs are not prohibitive).

 <div style="color:#9f0000;">
 <i>We also strongly encourage artifact submissions for already published optimization 
 techniques since one of the goal of ReQuEST tournaments is to prepare 
 a reference (baseline) set of implementations of various algorithms 
 shared as portable, customizable and reusable CK components 
 with a common API.</i>
 </div>

<p>
Example optimizations include:
<ul>
 <li>Design space exploration of model topologies, operators, activation functions, configurations.
 <li>Hyper-parameter search and meta-learning techniques that help optimize accuracy and inference time.
 <li>Comparison of different deep learning systems (for example TensorFlow vs. Caffe2 vs. CNTK vs. MXNet).
 <li>Model optimizations that trade accuracy for speed or efficiency (model compression).
 <li>Operator-level quantization, binarization or ternarization techniques to improve overall inference time (binary networks, XNOR nets).
 <li>Library optimizations targeting deep learning operators on mobile systems (e.g. depthwise convolution).
 <li>FPGA acceleration that takes advantage of narrow integer types.
 <li>Software optimizations targeting GPU-less mobile/IoT systems.
</ul>


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a id="call"><h3>How to submit</h3>

We follow <a href="http://ctuning.org/ae/submission.html">standard procedures</a> 
to submit experimental workflows for validation at systems conferences 
including CGO, PPoPP, PACT and SuperComputing (artifact evaluation):

<p>
<div style="padding:5px;">

 <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <b>Step 1: prepare experimental workflow</b>

 <div style="padding:5px;">
   Authors must prepare all scripts to build and run their experimental workflow,
   measure characteristics, compare with reference implementation, 
   and validate results on a target platform.

   Authors must also make sure that all artifacts required 
   to run their experimental workflow are publicly available.

   <p>
   If authors are familiar with the open-source 
   <a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck">Collective Knowledge workflow framework (CK)</a>,
   they are encouraged to convert their scripts and artifacts 
   to <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows">portable CK workflows</a>.

   Such workflows can automatically prepare environment, detect required software,
   install missing packages and run experiments thus simplifying validation of results.

   Authors can see and reuse various examples of already shared CK workflows and artifacts 
   <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-repos#ck-powered-projects-with-whole-experimental-setups-artifacts-and-workflows-shared-in-ck-format">here</a>.

   <p>
   If authors are not using CK (the learning curve can still be quite steep), 
   we will help them convert their submission to the CK during evaluation
   to unify experiments and automate validation of results.

   This can also help the community reuse such artifacts and workflows
   since ACM plans to <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/dl-pilot-integrations">integrate CK with their digital library</a>.
 </div>

 <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <b>Step 2: pack/share your workflow</b>

 <div style="padding:5px;">
   Authors must make all artifacts and experimental workflows publicly available
   via GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket and similar services or pack them in a zip/tar archive 
   or Docker/VM image.
   
   In exceptional cases, when rare hardware is used, authors can provide
   a remote access to their platform.
 </div>


 <p>
 <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <b>Step 3: prepare extended abstract with an Artifact Appendix</b>

 <div style="padding:5px;">
   Authors must prepare an extended abstract (4 pages max)
   using this <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/request/request-template.tex">ReQuEST LaTex template</a> 
   with a <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/sigplanconf.cls">SIGPLAN conference style</a>.

   This document must include their name, affiliation, and a brief description 
   of a novel optimization technique or already published work.

   It must also include an Artifact Appendix (already included to above template) 
   with a detailed specification of the experimental workflow, 
   a list of optimized metrics (speed, accuracy, energy, costs, etc)
   and a baseline to compete with other submissions.

   This specification must also describe how to obtain all related artifacts 
   to let reviewers independently evaluate experiments
   and validate optimization claims.
 </div>

 <p>
 <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <b>Step 4: submit extended abstract</b>

 <div style="padding:5px;">
   Authors must submit an extended abstract as a PDF via <a href="https://asplos18request.hotcrp.com">ReQuEST HotCRP website</a>.

   In case of problems, authors should contact <a href="mailto:moreau@cs.washington.edu;Grigori.Fursin@cTuning.org">organizers</a>.

 </div>
</div>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a id="evaluation"><h3>Evaluation</h3>

 ReQuest is backed by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/task-force-on-data-software-and-reproducibility">ACM Task Force on Data, Software, and Reproducibility in Publication</a>
 and will use the standard <a href="http://cTuning.org/ae/reviewing.html">ACM artifact evaluation methodology</a>.
 Artifact evaluation will be single blind (see <a href="http://cTuning.org/ae">PPoPP, CGO, PACT, RTSS and SuperComputing</a>),
 and the reviews can be made public (see <a href="http://adapt-workshop.org/submission2016.html">ADAPT</a>) upon the authors' request.
 Quality and efficiency metrics will be collected for each submission, and compiled on a ReQuEST live scoreboard similar 
 to this <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/repo">open optimization repository</a>.

 <p>
 <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <b>Step 1: converting all workflows to the common CK format</b>

 <div style="padding:5px;">
  If submission is not in the CK format, we will help authors convert it to the CK format
  while reusing various artifacts already shared by the community
 (see <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-repos#ck-powered-projects-with-whole-experimental-setups-artifacts-and-workflows-shared-in-ck-format">CK AI repositories</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-modules">CK modules (wrappers)</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-soft-descriptions">CK software detection plugins</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-packages">portable CK packages</a>).

  The authors can choose how to communicate with us during this step: either privately via HotCRP, 
  semi-privately via a <a href="https://request-workshop.slack.com">dedicated Slack channel with all authors and reviewers</a>,
  or publicly via <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/collective-knowledge">CK mailing list</a>
  (thus making the community immediately aware of their artifact).

 </div>

 <p>
 <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <b>Step 2: validating results</b>

 <div style="padding:5px;">
  A ReQuEST artifact evaluation committee (AEC) will be tasked
  to independently evaluate workflow submissions 
  on compliant hardware platforms, reproduce results 
  and aggregate them in a multi-objective public leaderboard. 

  It will be a cooperative and interactive process between authors 
  and evaluators to help authors fix problems
  and avoid ambiguities.

  <p>
  Authors should tell us if they prefer a public 
  (preferable - see <a href="http://adapt-workshop.org/motivation2016.html">our motivation</a>) 
  or a private evaluation
  which includes discussions with evaluators.

  A private evaluation and communication is performed via HotCRP.
  A semi-private evaluation and discussion can be performed via 
  <a href="https://request-workshop.slack.com">dedicated Slack channel with all authors and reviewers</a>.

  A public evaluation can be performed by opening tickets on GitHub and similar 
  services (see examples <a href="https://github.com/thu-pacman/self-checkpoint/issues/1">1</a>
  and <a href="https://gitlab.com/michel-steuwer/cgo_2017_artifact/issues/1">2</a>)
  and/or via <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/collective-knowledge">CK mailing list</a>.

  If organizers submit their workflows (mainly to provide reference implementations),
  such submissions must go through public evaluation
  and are not entitled for prizes.

  <p>
  Due to the multi-faceted nature of the
  competition, submissions will not be ranked according to a single
  metric (since it often result in over-engineered solutions), 
  but instead the AEC will assess their Pareto optimality
  across two or more metrics exposed by authors.

  There won't be a single ranking of submissions since this competition 
  is multi-objective: it accounts for classification accuracy, 
  inference latency, energy, ownership/usage cost and so on.

  As such, there won't be a single winner, but better and worse designs based on their
  relative Pareto optimality (up to 3 design points allowed per submission). 


   <p>

 </div>

 <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <b>Step 3: visualizing results in a public scoreboard</b>

 <p>
 <div style="padding:5px;">
  We will work with authors to correctly visualize all benchmarking results 
  and SW/HW/model configurations on a  <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/repo">public scoreboard</a>
  while grouping them according to certain categories of their choice (e.g.embedded vs. server). 

  <p>
  We will then announce winning SW/HW/model configurations which are either 
  close to Pareto-frontier in their category or if there is only one
  submission in a given category which becomes the reference one.

 </div>

 <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <b>Step 5: publishing extended abstracts and artifacts in the ACM Digital Library</b>

 <p>
 <div style="padding:5px;">

  Authors of the winning workflows will be able to publish their extended abstracts with an Artifact Appendix
  and related artifacts in the <a href="http://dl.acm.org">ACM Digital Library</a> (even for already published
  techniques since the focus of the workshop on validated and reusable artifacts)! 

  <i>Furthermore, we partnered with <a href="http://acm.org">ACM</a> to award 
  <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">"available, reusable, replicated" badges</a>
  to all winning artifacts. 

  This will make them discoverable via ACM Digital Library
  (check it out by selecting "Artifact Badge" for field and then select any badge you wish 
  in the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/advsearch.cfm?coll=DL&dl=ACM">ACM DL advanced search</a>)!</i>

  </center>

 </div>

 <!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <b>Step 5: presenting winning or novel workflows at the ASPLOS'18 workshop</b>

 <div style="padding:5px;">
  <p>
  Authors of the winning configurations or novel solutions 
  will be invited to present
  their approaches at the ReQuEST'18 workshop co-located 
  with <a href="https://www.asplos2018.org">ASPLOS 2018</a>
  (ACM conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems 
  - the premier forum for multidisciplinary systems research spanning computer architecture 
  and hardware, programming languages and compilers, operating systems and networking).

  It will give an opportunity for the participants
  to share their research and implementation insights with the research community
  as well as discuss future R&D directions.

  <p>
  A common academic and industrial panel will be held at the end of the
  workshop to discuss how to improve common SW/HW co-design methodology
  and infrastructure for deep learning and other real-world applications.

<a id="industrial_board"><h3>Advisory/industrial board</h3>

 <p>
 After the workshop we will prepare a report with the results to the ReQuEST board. 
 Members of the ReQuEST advisory/industrial board will then look over and comment on the results,
 collaborate on a common methodology for reproducible evaluation and optimization,
 suggest realistic workloads and arrange access to rare hardware to Artifact Evaluation Committee for the future tournaments,
 and provide prizes for the most efficient solutions.
