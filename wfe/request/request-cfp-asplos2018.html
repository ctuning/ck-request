<ul>
 <li><b>2017.Dec:</b> Open call for Pareto efficient, portable and reusable deep learning algorithms is now available. <i>Intent to submit: no later than <b>February 5, 2018</b></i>
</ul>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a id="call"><h3>Call for contributions</h3>

Co-designing emerging workloads across the hardware/software
stack to optimize for speed, accuracy, costs
and other metrics is extremely complex and time consuming. 

The lack of a rigorous methodology and common tools for open, 
reproducible  and multi-objective optimization makes it challenging 
or even impossible to evaluate
and compare different published works across numerous
heterogeneous hardware platforms, software frameworks,
compilers, libraries, algorithms, data sets, and environments.

<p>
The 1st ReQuEST workshop aims to bring together
multidisciplinary researchers in systems, compilers,
architecture and machine learning 
to optimize the quality vs. efficiency Pareto optimality of 
deep learning systems on complete hardware/software platforms
in a standardized, reproducible and comparable fashion.

The target application for the first incarnation of ReQuEST will
be the <b>ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge
(ILSVRC)</b> and will focus solely on optimizing inference
on real systems <!-- as suggested by our industrial advisory board -->.

Restricting the competition to a single application domain will allow us 
to test an open-source tournament infrastructure, validate it across 
multiple platforms and environments, and prepare 
a dedicated live scoreboard with the "winning" solutions similar
to this <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/repo">live optimization repository</a>.
For future incarnations of ReQuEST, we will provide broader application coverage.

<p>
Unlike the classical ILSVRC where submissions are ranked based
on accuracy, ReQuEST submissions will be evaluated 
across multiple metrics and trade-offs (exposed by authors): 
accuracy, speed, throughput, energy, cost of usage, etc.

Furthermore, in contrast with other deep learning benchmarking challenges 
where experimental results are submitted in a form of JSON, CSV or XLS files,
ReQuEST participants will be asked to submit a complete <i>workflow
artifact</i> (see submission procedures) which encompasses toolchains, 
frameworks, algorithm, libraries, and target hardware platform; 
any of which can be fine-tuned, or customized at will by the participant
to implement their optimization technique (i.e. not just some Docker or VM image).

<div style="color:#9f0000;">
<i>We strongly encourage artifact submissions for already published techniques 
since one of the ReQuEST goals is to prepare an open set of reference 
and optimized implementations of popular deep learning algorithms 
as portable and customizable workflows
which can be easily reused, improved and build upon!</i>
</div>

<p>
Example optimizations include:
<ul>
 <li>Design space exploration of model topologies, operators, activation functions, configurations.
 <li>Hyper-parameter search and meta-learning techniques that help optimize accuracy and inference time.
 <li>Comparison of different deep learning systems (for example TensorFlow vs. Caffe2 vs. CNTK vs. MXNet).
 <li>Model optimizations that trade accuracy for speed or efficiency (model compression).
 <li>Operator-level quantization, binarization or ternarization techniques to improve overall inference time (binary networks, XNOR nets).
 <li>Library optimizations targeting deep learning operators on mobile systems (e.g. depthwise convolution).
 <li>FPGA acceleration that takes advantage of narrow integer types.
 <li>Software optimizations targeting GPU-less mobile/IoT systems.
</ul>

A ReQuEST artifact evaluation committee (AEC) will be tasked
to independently reproduce and evaluate workflow submissions 
on compliant hardware platforms to reproduce results 
and aggregate them in a multi-objective public leaderboard. 

Due to the multi-faceted nature of the
competition, submissions won't be ranked according to a single
metric, but instead the AEC will assess their Pareto optimality
across two or more metrics exposed by authors.

There won't be a single ranking of submissions since this competition 
is multi-objective: it accounts for classification accuracy, 
inference latency, energy, ownership/usage cost and so on.

As such, there won't be a single winner, but better and worse designs based on their
relative Pareto optimality (up to 3 design points allowed per submission).

<b>We partnered with <a href="http://acm.org">ACM</a> to award 
<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">"available, reusable, replicated" badges</a>
to all winning artifacts and make them discoverable via ACM Digital Library
(check it out by selecting "Artifact Badge" for field and then select any badge you wish 
in the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/advsearch.cfm?coll=DL&dl=ACM">ACM DL advanced search</a>)!</b>

The workshop will be co-located with <a href="https://www.asplos2018.org">ASPLOS 2018</a>
(ACM conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems 
- the premier forum for multidisciplinary systems research spanning computer architecture 
and hardware, programming languages and compilers, operating systems and networking).
It will give an opportunity for the participants
to share their research and implementation insights with the research community.
A common academic and industrial panel will be held at the end of the
workshop to discuss how to improve common SW/HW co-design methodology 
for deep learning and other real-world applications.
