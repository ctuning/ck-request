<h2>ReQuEST: Reproducible Quality-Efficient Systems Tournaments</h2>

 <i>
  Our long-term goal is to develop a common methodology and framework
  for reproducible co-design of the efficient software/hardware stack 
  for emerging algorithms requested by our advisory board 
  (inference, object detection, training, etc) 
  in terms of speed, accuracy, energy, size, complexity, costs and other metrics.

  Open ReQuEST competitions bring together AI, ML and systems researchers
  to share complete algorithm implementations (code and data) as <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows">portable</a>, 
  customizable and reusable <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck">Collective Knowledge workflows</a>.

  This helps the community to quickly validate such results, reuse workflows and even run them 
  on different platforms with different or new models, data sets, libraries, compilers and tools.

  See <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck-request-asplos18-results">GitHub with shared workflows</a> 
  and the latest reproducible results at the <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/request-results">live ReQuEST scoreboard</a>.

<a id="goals"><h3>Long-term goals</h3>

<div style="margin-left:30px;">

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4>Our vision</h4>

  <div style="margin-left:20px;">

Developing efficient software and hardware for emerging workloads 
and optimizing it in terms of speed, accuracy, costs
and other metrics is extremely complex and time consuming. 

Furthermore, the lack of common infrastructure and rigorous methodology 
for reproducible evaluation and multi-objective optimization 
makes it even more challenging to validate
and compare different published works 
across numerous and continuously changing platforms, software frameworks,
compilers, libraries, algorithms, data sets, and environments.

<p>

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06378">ReQuEST</a> 
is aimed at providing a scalable tournament framework,
a common experimental methodology and an open repository 
for continuous evaluation and optimization 
of the quality vs. efficiency 
Pareto optimality of a wide range of real-world applications,
libraries and models across the whole hardware/software stack
on complete platforms.

In contrast with other (deep learning) benchmarking challenges 
where experimental results are submitted in a form of JSON, CSV or XLS files,
ReQuEST participants will be asked to submit a complete 
<i>workflow artifact</i> in a unified and automated form 
(i.e. not just some ad-hoc Docker/VM image)
which encompasses toolchains, frameworks, algorithm, libraries, 
and target hardware platform; 
any of which can be fine-tuned, or customized at will by the participant
to implement their optimization technique.

Such open infrastructure helps to bring together multidisciplinary researchers 
in systems, compilers, architecture and machine learning to develop
and share their algorithms, tools and techniques
as portable, customizable and "plug&play" components with a common API.

<p>
We then arrange open ReQuEST competitions on Pareto-efficient co-design 
of the whole software/hardware stack to continuously optimize such algorithms
in terms of speed, accuracy, energy, costs and other metrics
across diverse inputs and platforms from IoT to supercomputers.

All benchmarking results and winning SW/HW/model
configurations will be visualized on a 
<a href="http://cKnowledge.org/repo">public interactive dashboard</a>
and grouped according to certain categories 
(e.g.embedded vs. server). 

The winning artifacts will be discoverable via <a href="http://dl.acm.org">ACM Digital Library</a> 
to help the community reproduce, reuse, improve and compare against them
thanks to the common experimental framework.
  
<p>
We hope that our approach will help automate research and accelerate innovation!

    about our long-term vision.
   </center>

  </div>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4>Open tournament framework goal</h4>

  <div style="margin-left:20px;">
   ReQuEST promotes reproducibility of experimental results 
   and reusability/customization of research artifacts 
   by standardizing evaluation methodologies 
   and facilitating the deployment of efficient solutions 
   on heterogeneous platforms. 

   That is why we build our competition on top of an open-source and portable 
   workflow framework (<a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck">Collective Knowledge or CK</a>)
   and a <a href="http://cTuning.org/ae">standard artifact evaluation methodology</a>
   from premier ACM systems conferences (CGO, PPoPP, PACT, SuperComputing)
   to provide unified evaluation and
   a real-time leader-board of submissions. 

  <!-- Yearly competition workshops are held at top-tier conferences 
   to discuss insights and results from the tournament. -->
  </div>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4>Metrics and Pareto-optimality goals</h4>

  <div style="margin-left:20px;">
   ReQuEST promotes quality-awareness to the architecture and systems community, 
   and resource-awareness to the applications community and end-users. 

   The submissions and their evaluation metrics will be maintained
   in a public repository that includes a live leader board.
   Specific attention will be brought to submissions
   close to a Pareto frontier in a multi-dimensional space
   of accuracy, execution time, power/energy consumption,
   hardware/code/model footprint, monetary costs etc.

   <!-- Eventually we may want to converge on a few meaningful metrics 
   to assess quality on a per-application basis, 
   and efficiency on a per-platform basis. -->
  </div>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4>Application goals</h4>

  <div style="margin-left:20px;">
   In the long term, ReQuest will cover a comprehensive suite of workloads, datasets and models
   covering applications domains that are most relevant to researchers in academia and industry
   (AI, vision, robotics, quantum computing, scientific computing, etc).
   This suite will evolve according to feedback and contributions from the community 
   thus substituting ad-hoc, artificial, quickly outdated or non-representative benchmarks.
   Furthermore, all artifacts from this suite can be automatically plugged in to the ReQuEST 
   competition workflows to simplify, automate and accelerate systems research.

   <p>
   For the first iteration of ReQuEST at ASPLOS'18, we focus on Deep Learning.
   Our first step is to provide coverage for the
   <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a> 
   image classification challenge.
   Restricting the competition to a single application domain will allow us to prepare an open-source
   tournament infrastructure and validate it across multiple hardware platforms, deep learning frameworks, libraries, models and inputs.
   For future incarnations of ReQuEST, we will provide broader application coverage, based on the interests of the research community and the direction
   set by our industrial board.

   <p>
   Though our main focus is on end-to-end applications, we also plan to allow future submissions for (micro)kernels 
   such as matrix multiply, convolutions and transfer functions to facilitate
   participation from the compilers and computer architecture community.
   <!-- However, we will provide a separate scoreboard for such submissions. -->

  </div>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4>Complete platforms goals</h4>

  <div style="margin-left:20px;">
   ReQuEST aims at covering a comprehensive set of hardware systems from data-centers down 
   to sensory nodes, incorporating various forms of processors including GPUs, DSPs, FPGAs, 
   neuromorphic and even analogue accelerators in the long term. 

   <p>
   In general, we want to encourage participants to target accessible, off-the-shelf
   hardware to allow our artifact evaluation committee to conveniently reproduce their results. 
   Example systems include:
   <ul>
    <li> 
     Server-class: AWS/Azure cloud instance, any x86-based desktop system.
    </li>
    <li>
     Mobile-class: Any ARM-based (e.g. NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Raspberry Pi 3, Xilinx PYNQ board), or Intel-Atom-based SoC development board, Android-based smartphone or tablets.
    </li>
    <li>
     IoT-class: Low-power ARM micro-controllers (e.g. Freescale FRDM KL03 Development Board).
    </li>
   </ul>

   If a submission relies on an exotic hardware platform,
   the participants can
   either provide restricted access to their evaluation platform
   to the artifact evaluation committee, or at least notify 
   in advance (at least 3 weeks notice) the organizers of their choice so that a similar platform 
   can be acquired in time (assuming costs are not prohibitive).

   <!-- <p>
   We plan to certify 1-2 power analyzers supported 
   by our evaluation framework. The organizing
   committee may use a high-precision power analyzer 
   (e.g. Yokogawa WT310 used for LPIRC costing $3,000-4,000)
   to calibrate a low-cost power analyzer (e.g. Hardkernel
   SmartPower2 costing $37), and use the calibration results
   when determining the winners. -->

   <p>
   In the longer term, we also plan to provide support for simulator-based
   evaluations for architecture/micro-architecture research.
   <!-- Simulator-based research will be presented in a separate leaderboard
   with meta-performance models
   to extrapolate public simulation results to real systems and help 
   refine models used in simulators.
   When validated, we can "promote" simulation results to the main scoreboard. -->

  </div>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <a id="submission"><h4>Unified submission goal</h4>

  <div style="margin-left:20px;">
   Authors need to submit a short document briefly describing their novel optimization technique
   or referencing already published paper, and providing a detailed specification 
   of the experimental workflow including all related artifacts, 
   evaluation methodology, and improved metrics to compete with other submissions.

   <p>
   <div style="color:#9f0000;">
   <i>Note that novelty of the implemented techniques is not a requirement! 
   We actually strongly encourage artifact submissions of already published techniques for which artifacts don't exist yet.
   We will independently reproduce them to prepare an open set of reference implementations
   of popular algorithms/frameworks/optimizations in a form of portable and customizable workflows
   which can be easily reused and build upon!</i>
   </div>

   <p>
   We want to unify every submission to enable fair evaluation. 
   That is why we decided to use the open-source 
   <a href="http://cKnowledge.org">Collective Knowledge workflow framework (CK)</a>.
   CK helps <a href="http://cknowledge.org/partners.html">the community</a> share artifacts 
   (models, data sets, libraries, tools) as reusable and customizable components with a common JSON API and meta description.
   CK also helps implement portable workflows which can <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows">adapt to a user environment</a> 
   on Linux, Windows, MacOS and Android.
   <a href="http://acm.org">ACM</a> currently <a href="https://dl.acm.org/reproducibility.cfm">evaluates CK</a> 
   to enabling sharing of reusable and portable artifacts in an ACM Digital Library.

   <p>
   <a href="http://cTuning.org">Non-profit cTuning foundation</a> will help authors convert their artifacts 
   and experimental scripts to the CK format during evaluation while reusing AI artifacts 
   already shared by the community in the CK format
   (see <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-repos#user-content-shared-workflows">CK AI repositories</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-modules">CK modules (wrappers)</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-soft-descriptions">CK software detection plugins</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-packages">portable CK packages</a>).

   Authors can also try to convert their workflows to the CK format themselves
   using the distinguished artifact from ACM CGO'17 as an example (
   see <a href="https://github.com/SamAinsworth/reproduce-cgo2017-paper">Artifact repository at GitHub</a>, 
   <a href="http://ctuning.org/ae/resources/paper-with-distinguished-ck-artifact-and-ae-appendix-cgo2017.pdf">Artifact Appendix</a>,
   <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Artifact-sharing">CK notes</a>,
   <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows">CK portable workflows</a>) 
   though the learning curve is still quite steep - we plan to prepare CK tutorials
   based on the feeback from the participants.

  </div>

  <h4>Open evaluation and live leader board goals</h4>

  <div style="margin-left:20px;">
   ReQuest is backed by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/task-force-on-data-software-and-reproducibility">ACM Task Force on Data, Software, and Reproducibility in Publication</a>
   and will use the standard <a href="http://cTuning.org/ae/reviewing.html">ACM artifact evaluation methodology</a>.
   Artifact evaluation will be single blind (see <a href="http://cTuning.org/ae">PPoPP, CGO, PACT, RTSS and SuperComputing</a>),
   and the reviews can be made public (see <a href="http://adapt-workshop.org/submission2016.html">ADAPT</a>) upon the authors' request.
   Quality and efficiency metrics will be collected for each submission,
   and compiled on the <a href="http://cknowledge.org/repo/web.php?native_action=show&native_module_uoa=program.optimization&scenario=a555738be4b65860">ReQuEST live scoreboard</a>.

   <p>
   ReQuEST will not determine a single winner, as collapsing all of the metrics into one single metric across all platforms 
   will result in over-engineered solutions.
   Instead, each ReQuEST tournament will expose a set of quality, performance and efficiency metrics
   to perform optimizations on.

  </div>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4>Open dissemination goals (ReQuEST workshops)</h4>

  <div style="margin-left:20px;">
   We will organize ReQuEST workshops associated with tournaments
   to let authors present and discuss their most efficient algorithms. 

   We will also use workshops as an open forum to discuss 
   how to improve our common reproducible methodology and framework
   for SW/HW co-design of emerging workloads with a broad 
   academic and industrial community!

   <p>
   Solutions do not have to be on the Pareto frontier to be accepted for such workshops
   and the open ReQuEST repository - a submission can be praised for its originality, reproducibility, 
   adaptability, scalability, portability, ease of use, etc. 

   <p>
   However, reproducible submissions on the Pareto frontier 
   will have an option to be published in the ACM Digital Library with 
   <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">ACM available, reusable and replicated badges</a>.

   This will make them discoverable via ACM DL search engine - 
   you can check this new feature yourself (since 2018) by selecting "Artifact Badge" for field 
   and then select any badge you wish in the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/advsearch.cfm?coll=DL&dl=ACM">ACM DL advanced search</a>!

  </div>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4>Advisory/industrial board goal</h4>

  <div style="margin-left:30px;">

   <p>
   Members of the ReQuEST advisory/industrial board will look over and comment on the results
   of our tournaments and workshops, collaborate on a common methodology for reproducible evaluation and optimization,
   suggest realistic workloads for future tournaments,
   arrange access to rare hardware to Artifact Evaluation Committee,
   and provide prizes for the most efficient solutions.
  </div>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h4>Open research goal</h4>

  <div style="margin-left:20px;">
   ReQuest attempts to put systems researchers, application engineers and end-users on the same ground
   by providing a common and portable evaluation framework while sharing all artifacts and optimization results
   in an open and reproducible way.

   We expect that our open repository with customizable, reusable and optimized artifacts will be useful for

   <ul>
    <li>
     scientists to accelerate their research by picking up the most efficient, resource-aware 
     and input-adaptable solutions for their algorithms;
    </li>
    <li>
     SW/HW researchers to reuse, improve and build upon each others' work
     (main pillars of open science) thus accelerating machine learning and systems research;
    </li>
    <li>
     system designers and integrators to accelerate development of the next generation of efficient hardware and software
     for emerging workloads such as deep learning using publicly validated optimization results.
    </li>
