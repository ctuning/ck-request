Energy efficiency is increasingly important as battery-powered systems (such as smartphones, drones, and body cameras) are widely used. It is desirable using the on-board computers to recognize objects in the images captured by these cameras. The Low-Power Image Recognition Challenge (LPIRC) is an annual competition started in 2015, aiming to discover the best technology in both image recognition and energy conservation. In this talk, we will explains the rules of the competition and the rationale, summarizes the teams' scores, and describes the lessons learned in the past years. We will also discuss possible improvements of future challenges and collaboration opportunities with other events and competitions like ReQuEST."

He now is a tenured Associate Professor of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University and serving as the co-director of Duke Center for Evolutionary Intelligence (CEI), focusing on the research of new memory and storage systems, machine learning and neuromorphic computing, and mobile computing systems. Dr. Chen has published one book and more than 300 technical publications and has been granted 93 US patents. He is the associate editor of IEEE TNNLS, IEEE D&T, IEEE ESL, ACM JETC, and ACM TCPS, and served on the technical and organization committees of more than 40 international conferences. He received 6 best paper awards and 12 best paper nominations from international conferences. He is the recipient of NSF CAREER award and ACM SIGDA outstanding new faculty award. He is the Fellow of IEEE."
