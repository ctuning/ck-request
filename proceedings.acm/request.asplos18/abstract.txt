Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and other emerging workloads 
demand efficient computer systems from the cloud to the edge. 
Systems designers, however, face numerous challenges from tackling 
the ever-growing space of design and optimization choices 
(including algorithms, models, software frameworks, libraries, 
hardware platforms, optimization techniques) to balancing off 
multiple objectives (including accuracy, speed, throughput, power, size, price). 
Furthermore, the lack of a common experimental framework and methodology 
makes it even more challenging to keep up with and build upon the latest research advances.

The Reproducibly Quality-Efficient Systems Tournaments 
(<a href="http://cknowledge.org/request">ReQuEST</a>) 
initiative is a community effort to develop 
a rigorous methodology, open platform 
and <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/repo">online scoreboard</a>
for co-designing the efficient and reliable software/hardware 
stack for emerging workloads. ReQuEST invites a multidisciplinary 
community to collaborate on benchmarking and optimizing workloads 
across diverse platforms, models, data sets, libraries and tools, 
while gradually adopting best practice. The community effectively creates 
a "marketplace" for trading Pareto-efficient implementations (code and data) 
as portable, customizable and reusable 
<a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck">Collective Knowledge</a> 
<a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki#user-content-reusable-ck-components">workflows</a> 
and <a href="http://cknowledge.org/shared-packages.html">packages</a>. 
We envision that such a community-driven and decentralized marketplace
will help accelerate adoption and technology transfer of novel AI/ML 
techniques similar to the open-source movement.

Please see the front matter for the 1st ReQuEST tournament 
on Co-designing Pareto-efficient Deep Learning Inference 
at ASPLOS'18 to learn more about the shared workflows 
and validated results, as well as about our next steps 
for the ReQuEST initiative.
